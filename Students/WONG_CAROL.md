# Efficacy of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy in the Treatment of PTSD: A Systematic Review
**Journal:** _Plos One_

Exposure treatment is considered to be the first-line treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and the usage of tools such as Virtual Reality (VR) equipment and VR systems may prove to be more helpful for patients who are resistant to traditional exposure, as it is more likely that a patient will be engaged, and thus, will activate the traumatic memory which is necessary to help extinguish the fear. A systematic review was conducted on 10 articles that used Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and VR systems to perform exposure therapy for patients with PTSD, and found that VR is as effective as traidtional exposure treatment and did not have a different dropout rate. However, because this is a new field of research, methodologically stronger trials and a standardization of treatment is necessary to confirm these results.
